# Fwaaa #

I think I was going for a little car. And also starting to use modules
to break up my code a bit.

- Time to first interaction: _6mins_

## Controls ##

- W, A, S, D: _Forward, Brake, Left, Right_
- Space: _???_

## Setup ##

This uses modules so you'll need to run a local web server. If you
have Python > 3.5 installed you can just:

    $ python -m http.server 8080

From the `src/` directory and then just point your browser at
`http://localhost:8080/`.
